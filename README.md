# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake game implemented in Python using the Tkinter library. The game allows you to control a snake to eat food and grow while avoiding collisions with the walls and the snake itself.

## Features

1. **Game Controls**: Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's direction.

2. **Scoring**: Your score increases every time the snake eats food. Try to achieve the highest score possible.

3. **Collision Detection**: The game checks for collisions with the walls and the snake's own body. If a collision occurs, the game ends.

4. **Game Over**: When the game ends, it displays a "GAME OVER" message along with your final score.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script `snake_game.py` to start the game.

2. Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction and guide it to eat the food.

3. Aim to score as many points as you can before the game ends due to a collision.

4. The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or itself, and it displays your final score.

## Dependencies

This game requires Python and the Tkinter library. No additional libraries or packages are needed.

## Customization

You can customize the game by modifying the following constants in the `snake_game.py` script:

- `GAME_WIDTH` and `GAME_HEIGHT`: Adjust the size of the game window.

- `SPEED`: Control the game speed. Lower values make the game faster.

- `SPACE_SIZE`: Set the size of each grid space in the game.

- `SNAKE_COLOR` and `FOOD_COLOR`: Change the colors of the snake and the food.

- `BACKGROUND_COLOR`: Modify the background color of the game.

## Future Enhancements

This is a basic implementation of the Snake game. Here are some ideas for future enhancements:

1. **Levels**: Implement multiple levels with increasing difficulty.

2. **High Scores**: Save and display high scores to encourage competition.

3. **Power-Ups**: Add power-ups that affect gameplay.

4. **Sound Effects**: Include sound effects for eating food, collisions, and other events.

5. **Graphics**: Enhance the game with better graphics and animations.

6. **Obstacles**: Introduce obstacles that the snake must navigate around.

7. **Multiplayer**: Create a multiplayer version where multiple players can compete.

Remember, this game is intended for educational purposes and as a starting point for learning Python and game development with Tkinter. Feel free to modify and expand upon it to create your own unique Snake game experience.
