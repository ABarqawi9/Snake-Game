# Snake Game

## Description

Welcome to the Snake Game! This Python script resurrects the classic Snake Game using Python and the Tkinter library. Relive the excitement of controlling a snake, gobbling up food, and growing while dodging walls and yourself.

## Features

- **Game Controls**: Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to direct the snake's movements.

- **Scoring**: Your score increases each time the snake devours food. Strive for the highest score!

- **Collision Detection**: The game monitors collisions with walls and the snake's own body. Collisions lead to game over.

- **Game Over**: When the game concludes, it displays a "GAME OVER" message along with your final score.

## Prerequisites

To play the Snake Game, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

## How to Play

1. Execute the script using a Python interpreter.

2. Utilize the arrow keys to guide the snake toward food while avoiding collisions.

3. Attempt to achieve the highest score before the game ends due to a collision.

4. The game concludes if the snake collides with walls or itself, displaying your final score.

## Customization

Customize the game by modifying the following constants in the `snake_game.py` script:

- `GAME_WIDTH` and `GAME_HEIGHT`: Adjust the game window's dimensions.

- `SPEED`: Control the game's speed. Lower values increase the game's pace.

- `SPACE_SIZE`: Determine the size of each grid space in the game.

- `SNAKE_COLOR` and `FOOD_COLOR`: Modify the snake and food colors.

- `BACKGROUND_COLOR`: Change the game's background color.

## Future Enhancements

While this version is a basic implementation of Snake, here are some ideas for future enhancements:

1. **Levels**: Incorporate multiple levels with increasing difficulty.

2. **High Scores**: Implement a high-score system to encourage competition.

3. **Power-Ups**: Add power-ups that impact gameplay.

4. **Sound Effects**: Include sound effects for eating food, collisions, and other events.

5. **Graphics**: Enhance the game with improved graphics and animations.

6. **Obstacles**: Introduce obstacles that the snake must navigate around.

7. **Multiplayer**: Create a multiplayer version for multiple players to compete.
