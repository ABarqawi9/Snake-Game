## Description

Welcome to the Snake Game! This Python script brings back the classic Snake Game to life using Python and the Tkinter library. Enjoy controlling a snake, eating food, and growing while avoiding collisions with walls and yourself.

## Features

- **Game Controls**: Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's direction.

- **Scoring**: Your score increases every time the snake eats food. Try to achieve the highest score possible.

- **Collision Detection**: The game checks for collisions with the walls and the snake's own body. If a collision occurs, the game ends.

- **Game Over**: When the game ends, it displays a "GAME OVER" message along with your final score.

## Prerequisites

Before playing the Snake Game, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

## How to Play

1. Run the script using a Python interpreter.

2. Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction and guide it to eat the food.

3. Aim to score as many points as you can before the game ends due to a collision.

4. The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or itself, and it displays your final score.

## Customization

You can customize the game by modifying the following constants in the `snake_game.py` script:

- `GAME_WIDTH` and `GAME_HEIGHT`: Adjust the size of the game window.

- `SPEED`: Control the game speed. Lower values make the game faster.

- `SPACE_SIZE`: Set the size of each grid space in the game.

- `SNAKE_COLOR` and `FOOD_COLOR`: Change the colors of the snake and the food.

- `BACKGROUND_COLOR`: Modify the background color of the game.

## Future Enhancements

This is a basic implementation of the Snake game. Here are some ideas for future enhancements:

1. **Levels**: Implement multiple levels with increasing difficulty.

2. **High Scores**: Save and display high scores to encourage competition.

3. **Power-Ups**: Add power-ups that affect gameplay.

4. **Sound Effects**: Include sound effects for eating food, collisions, and other events.

5. **Graphics**: Enhance the game with better graphics and animations.

6. **Obstacles**: Introduce obstacles that the snake must navigate around.

7. **Multiplayer**: Create a multiplayer version where multiple players can compete.
